title: Yokadi 1.0.1 released, only minor changes
author: Aurelien

Shortly after the release of 1.0.0, I realized installing Yokadi via pip was broken: pip would not automatically install the required dependencies.

I fixed that issue and improved the release process so that pip install is always tested before releasing. These changes are in version 1.0.1, which [has just been released](/download.html).
