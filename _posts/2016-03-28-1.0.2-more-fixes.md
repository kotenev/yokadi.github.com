title: Yokadi 1.0.2 released, more fixes!
author: Aurelien

A few bugs managed to sneak in 1.0.1, hopefully all of them has been fixed in this new version.

Here is the bug fix list for this version:

- Use a more portable way to get the terminal size. This makes it possible to use Yokadi inside Android terminal emulators like [Termux][]
- Sometimes the task lock used to prevent editing the same task description from multiple Yokadi instances was not correctly released
- Deleting a keyword from the database caused a crash when a `t_list` returned tasks which previously contained this keyword
