Here it is, a new release of Yokadi for your TODO listing pleasure! Version
0.11.0 brings you a much nicer t\_list output:

- The width of the title column now adjusts itself to fit your terminal width and
  the content to display.
- Task keywords are now printed in the title column.
- Using the new -k switch, you can group tasks by keywords instead of grouping
  them by project.

0\.11.0 also brings you a few handy shortcuts:

- Special character '\_' can be used to represent last task id in all task
  commands: handy to add a due date after adding a task: just type "t\_due \_
  tomorrow" to set the last used task due date to tomorrow.
- Custom aliases can be defined for all commands with a\_add.

Other changes:

- Bugs keywords are prefixed with a '\_' to distinguish them from user
  keywords.
- YOKADI\_DB environment variable can be defined to set default yokadi database
  path.
- Switch from "GPL v3" to "GPL v3 or newer" license.
