title: Akademy release!
author: Sebastien

It is more and more an habit: a new yokadi release was done during
[Akademy](http://akademy.kde.org/), the annual world summit of
the [KDE community](http://www.kde.org).

Here are the highlights of the 0.12 release:
- Negative keyword support. Ex.: t_list !@home
- Permanent filters on keyword or project. 't_filter @foo' will filter any further call to t_list on @foo keyword.
- filter tasks on due date. Ex.: t_list --due tomorrow, t_list --due sunday
- add Notes support for things that belong to a project without being a task. Add it with n_add and list it with n_list.

As usual, we hope you like it as much as we do.

[Grab it](/download.html), have a look at the [README](/README.html)
and start getting organized!
