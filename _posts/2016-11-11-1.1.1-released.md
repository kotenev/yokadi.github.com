Today is the 11th of November: 11-11 is a great date to release version 1.1.1 :) Lame joke apart, this new version brings the following changes:

- Improvements:
    - When listing multiple projects, order them alphabetically.
- Bug fixes:
    - Fixed parse error if the user sets a time of "17m".
    - When the user edits a tasks with `t_edit` and removes a keyword, remove the keyword from the task.
    - Made recurrence code work with dateutil 2.6.0.

Nothing earth shattering, but a few nice to have. Get it from the [download page](/download.html).
